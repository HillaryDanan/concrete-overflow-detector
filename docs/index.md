# Concrete Overflow Detection Framework Documentation

## Overview

This framework provides linguistic analysis tools to identify patterns that may indicate concrete vs abstract processing in text, based on neuroscience research findings.

## What This Framework Does

- **Linguistic Pattern Analysis**: Analyzes word choice, syntax, and semantic patterns
- **Theoretical Mapping**: Maps linguistic patterns to theoretical neural correlates from research
- **Scoring System**: Provides metrics based on detected patterns
- **Visualization**: Displays pattern breakdowns

## What This Framework Does NOT Do

- ❌ Measure actual brain activity
- ❌ Diagnose conditions
- ❌ Test for consciousness
- ❌ Validate AI safety

## Technical Details

The framework analyzes several linguistic features:

1. **Lexical Features**
   - Abstract vs concrete word ratios
   - Mechanical/statistical language markers
   - Metaphor literalization patterns

2. **Syntactic Features**
   - Sentence complexity
   - Clause structures
   - Coherence markers

3. **Semantic Features**
   - Abstract/concrete noun ratios
   - Social-mechanical processing patterns
   - Response specificity

## Theoretical Basis

Based on Levinson (2021) dissertation findings:
- dmPFC activation patterns in abstract reasoning
- Thalamic activation in concrete processing
- Differences between typical and atypical cognition

**Note**: All neural mappings are theoretical, not empirical measurements.

## Usage

See README.md for installation and quick start guide.

## Limitations

This is a v0.1 research prototype. Extensive validation is needed before any practical applications.
