# Example Analyses

This folder will contain example analyses demonstrating the framework's linguistic pattern detection.

## Planned Examples

- Analysis of different AI model responses
- Comparison of abstract vs concrete language patterns
- Demonstration of various failure modes
- Correlation with human perception data (when available)

## Contributing Examples

If you test the framework and find interesting patterns, please consider contributing your examples with:
- The input text
- The analysis results
- Your interpretation
- Any relevant context

## Note

All examples are for research purposes. Results are based on linguistic analysis, not neural measurements.
